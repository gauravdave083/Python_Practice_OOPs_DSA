# Python DSA and OOP

Welcome to the **Python DSA and OOP** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python implementations for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as well as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It is designed to serve as a resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in strengthening their understanding and skills in these fundamental areas of computer science.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables, and more.
- **Algorithms**: A variety of algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph traversal, and others.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Examples and explanations of OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples and problem-solving techniques using DSA and OOP principles.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `data_structures/`: Contains implementation of various data structures.
- `algorithms/`: Includes different algorithms categorized by their functionality.
- `oop_concepts/`: Demonstrates OOP concepts with examples and explanations.
- `examples/`: Contains practical examples and problem-solving scenarios.

## Getting Started
